# Exact ground effect

This repository contains the codes needed to produce the (theoretical) results in the paper ["Exact solutions for ground effect"](https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.02713). The basic setup is illustrated below:

The repository includes the complex potential functions:
* ```circulation.m``` -- circulatory flows
* ```vortex.m``` -- point vortices
* ```uniform.m``` -- uniform flows
* ```strain.m``` -- straining flows, and
* ```movement.m``` -- motion of the wing.
